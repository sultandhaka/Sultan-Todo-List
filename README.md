# Sultan-Todo-List
Sultan To-do list app is developed to manage everyday tasks very easily. For a human, itâ€™s very difficult to remember all the planned tasks in a day. One or more tasks could be forgotten from the mind if not listed task plan in a paper. Considering this I have developed this app.
App has a local database to store all tasks. So, the added tasks will be stored in the database and can be displayed after reboot the app.
Completed tasks will be removed from the database after tap on the Task completed button from the list screen.
